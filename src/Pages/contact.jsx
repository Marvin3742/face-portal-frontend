            question: "Is my photo stored or shared?",

            question: "What photo formats are supported?",

            question: "How long does it take to generate results?",
            answer: "Processing typically takes 15-30 seconds depending on image size and complexity. Larger images may take slightly longer to process."

            question: "Can I use photos of other people?",

            question: "What age ranges can the AI predict?",
            answer: "Our model can age faces forward or backward by 10-20 years. The accuracy tends to be higher for moderate age changes (10-15 years) compared to extreme changes."
        },
        {
            question: "Why doesn't my result look realistic?",
            answer: "Several factors can affect quality: photo lighting, angle, resolution, or facial obstructions. For the best results we strongly recommend uploading a high quality front facing selfie free of any glasses or hats."
